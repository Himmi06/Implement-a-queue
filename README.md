# Implement-a-queue


 Q.7) Design a scheduling program to implements a Queue with two levels:
      Level 1 : Fixed priority preemitive scheduling
      Level 2 : Round Robin scheduling
      For a Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling (Queue 1), 
      the Priority 0 is highest priority. If one process P1
      is scheduled
      and running , another process P2 with higher priority
      comes. The New process (high priority) process P2 preempts
      currently running process P1 and process P1 will go to second
      level queue. Time for which process will strictly execute
      must be considered in the multiples of 
      2. All the processes in second level queue will complete their
       execution according to round robin scheduling.
